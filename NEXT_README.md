# NOTES FOR THIS MARKDOWN
- Bundles seperate different areas of HTML, as to not load unused methods
- Should the user want to create "Component"/Custom Functors, SharpTemplar.Monadic should be imported
- Markup() starts a document.
- _() is the generic Functor application method
- Functors are delegates, but most have associated extension methods
  - extensions starting with lower case represent html tags
  - extensions starting with '@' represent mutations of html tags (fx. attributes)
  - extensions starting with upper case, represent other functions (Navigation ect.)
- Enter moves the html pointer to the newest added element
- Exit moves the html pointer to the parent of the current element
- If applies a Functor, if it boolean argument is true, otherwise it might apply another Functor, or nothing
- Attempt applies a Functor, but if this application throws an exception, changes are reverted and an alternative Functor might be applied
- Range applies a Functor a number of times. The Functor might make the current iteration number as an argument
- OnList applies a Functor, taking some type T as an argument, for each element of a List of this type T
- @id is a special case of mutation attribute, as it keeps track of which ids are already in use
